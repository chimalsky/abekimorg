description: Freedom of Feelings
---

- i think a lot of people have narrow views on how they should feel about things. They mostly let what they already know  -- things they've seen in good light like movies growing up -- be the only things they feel at all... and most likely they only allow these feelings to happen in the same contexts as they've seen them occur.
- I think that's why they people are so obsessed with romantic love. They hear love and automatically it's a romantic thing. When they start feeling it with someone else than they reflexively cringe.  
- A thing that's been happening in my life recently is increased freedom of how I feel things. Right around the first time I met you I was a bit ontop a high horse because when I looked around me it felt like my [[feelings-freedom]] was on a higher level than other people. But as I matured and progressed -- with some regressive years along the way -- I kept observing the extent to which my feelings were controlled by conceptions of how feelings ought to be had.
